# Altium Libraries for JLCPCB Basic Resistors and Capacitors

These are Altium database libraries for JLCPCB current “Basic” SMT resistors and capacitors.
There are separate libraries for:
0402 - 0603 - 0805 - 1206 


The MATLAB code / regex that was used to generate the database is also included.
Hopefully this will allow a future user to update the libraries as the "basic" parts change.
The input for the MATLAB code is raw text, copy pasted from the JLC parts website, into the “Cap XXXX.txt” files in the Data folder.

## The STEP files that are used in the PCB footprints are from

 - [SMT Capacitor Step source](https://grabcad.com/library/mlcc-surface-mount-capacitors-1)
 - [SMT Resistors Step source](https://grabcad.com/library/surface-mount-resistors-1)
